# vid-dlp

A simple and powerful Python tool to download files by searching, crawling and extracting encrypted links. 

# WHY?

I wanted an easy way to automatically download video files and extract their audio from multiple websites and without being bothered by ads or unnecessary interaction. This script uses modern technologies and amazing tools like playwright, yt-dlp and ffmpeg to achieve this seamlessly.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Python
First, you need Python installed on your computer:
- **Windows**: Download from [python.org](https://python.org) and run the installer
- **Mac**: Download from [python.org](https://python.org) or use `brew install python`
- **Linux**: Usually pre-installed, or run `sudo apt install python3`

### Step 2: Download This Tool
1. Download all the files in this folder to your computer
2. Open a command prompt/terminal in this folder

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Run these commands one by one:

```bash
# Install Python packages
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pycryptodome playwright yt-dlp

# Install the browser
playwright install firefox
```

### Step 4: Install FFmpeg (For Audio Downloads)
- **Windows**: Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), extract to a folder, and add that folder to your PATH
- **Mac**: Run `brew install ffmpeg` in terminal
- **Linux**: Run `sudo apt install ffmpeg` (Ubuntu) or `sudo yum install ffmpeg` (CentOS)

### Step 5: Run the Tool
```bash
python downloader.py
```

## üìñ How to Use (Step by Step)

1. **Run the script**: Type `python downloader.py` and press Enter
2. **Enter video title**: Type the name of what you want to download (e.g., "Harry Potter 4")
3. **Choose language**: Pick your preferred language (Latino/Espa√±ol/Ingl√©s)
4. **Customize options** (optional): Choose between:
   - Video + Audio (full video file)
   - Audio only (just the sound as MP3)
5. **Wait**: The tool will automatically:
   - Search for your video
   - Find the best quality version
   - Download it to the `downloads` folder

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Python not found"**
